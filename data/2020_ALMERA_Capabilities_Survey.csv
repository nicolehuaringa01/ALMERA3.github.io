Energy calibration in a whole region of energies is checked before applying the QC procedure, which includes measurement of the detector-shield background, total activity, peak shape, and peak drift. These parameters are tracked with warning and acceptance limits (long term trend is analysed). A Co-60 point source is used for that purpose. Results of the QC are stored in a database and can be displayed and charted. Gas proportional counter: before every analytical batch, the background count rate and efficiency of the counter are checked (alpha efficiency with Am-241 and beta with Sr-90/Y-90 source). Gamma-spectrometry method: internal QC covers analysis of control samples - certified reference materials, reference materials or laboratory control samples according to the appropriate plan and program of quality control. Internal quality control method is performed through blank measurements and measurements of a control sample before each set of samples to check the accuracy and precision of the method. For control samples, the Laboratory uses reference materials and samples obtained through ALMERA intercomparison exercises.

There are also 9 stations operated by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW), 7 of which conduct the continuous measurement of ambient gamma dose rate and the continuous measurement of total and artificial alpha and beta activity of atmospheric aerosols. The stations also measure total beta activity in 24-hour and monthly samples of total fallout, and  determine the content of Cs-137 (by a spectrometric method) and Sr-90 (by a radiochemical method) in cumulative monthly samples of total fallout from all 9 stations once a month.

These stations conduct ongoing measurements of the power of the spatial dose equivalent H*(10), ambient gamma dose rate and spectrum caused by radioactive elements in the air and in the ground, and basic weather parameters (precipitation and ambient temperature). The 9 stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW) also conduct continuous measurements of ambient gamma dose rate and take measurements of the activity of atmospheric aerosols and total precipitation. There are also 13 auxiliary stations of the Ministry of National Defence (MON) that perform measurements of ambient gamma dose rate. ",No,,"Emergency exposure situations: 
in cases of radiation emergency, intervention measures are taken based on whether the incident is occurring within the area of a given organizational unit (on-site emergency incidents), or for those incidents with impacts reaching beyond the organizational unit ('regional' and 'national' emergency incidents, including those of cross-border effects). The head of the given entity, a provincial governor or a minister of the interior are in charge of eliminating the hazard and the consequences of the incident, depending on the scale of emergency.  
Around nuclear facilities: radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the Świerk Nuclear Centre is conducted by our laboratory (that is, the Radiation Protection Measurements Laboratory of the National Centre for Nuclear Research) according to a monitoring programme approved by the President of PAA. There are additional independent specialized centres selected annually by the President of PAA in the vicinity of the Centre which also carry out monitoring duties. Radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the National Radioactive Waste Repository (KSOP) is conducted by the Radioactive Waste Management Plant and by the nearby laboratory commissioned by the PAA’s President. 
Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): the 'Program of radiological monitoring of areas degraded due to uranium ore extraction and processing' has been implemented at the former uranium ore plants since 1998. In 2018 the following measures were undertaken: measurements of radioactive alpha and beta isotopes in drinking water (from public water intakes) within the territory managed by the Association of Municipalities of the Karkonosze Region, as well as in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings); and the determination of radon concentration in water from public intakes, in water supplied to residential premises, and in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings).

The radionuclides involved were gamma emitters, gross alpha and  gross-beta, tritium, Rn-222, transuranic elements, uranium, Sr-90, Po-210 and Ra-226.

- A fundamental aspect regarding quality assurance of measurements is the regular participation in intercomparison exercises or proficiency test programs organized by laboratories with international recognition (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Physical Laboratory (NPL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
- Calibration of the measurement systems according to each laboratory using calibration sources or certified reference materials from internationally recognized laboratories. 
- Preparation of control charts to verify that equipments measure correctly. 
- Verification of background measurements for the measurement system. 
- Verification of detection limit of techniques in case of bakground variation. 
- Recording of technical maintenance carried out regularly. 
- Verification of robustness by using NIST traceable standards, when changing for example the batch of Liquid Scintillation Counter cocktails. 
- Verification of micropipettes used. 
- Determination of chemical efficiency for sample batches, for example for Sr-90 analysis. 
- For techniques that are validated, a validation of the method will be carried out in successive stages by laboratory analysts, evaluating the following variables according to the experimental results obtained in terms of: Accuracy, Intermediate Accuracy, Repeatability, Reproducibility , Robustness, Minimum Detectable Concentration. 
- Accreditation of laboratories under ISO 17025 Standard started in 2006 to demonstrate that there is a quality management system and the laboratories are technically competent to generate valid results.

Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): uranium sites are not considered legacy sites as they are under regulatory control.

In the case of the international trade of food, we use the guideline values established by Codex Alimentarius for international trade. In the hypothetical case the measured activity concentration is higher than the corresponding Guideline Levels, since these levels are quite conservative. The evaluation of the effective dose due to the annual consumption of radionuclides in food must be calculated with country-specific values (national consumption for example).
