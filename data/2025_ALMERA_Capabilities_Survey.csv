- Preparation of control charts to verify that equipments measure correctly. 
- Verification of background measurements for the measurement system. 
- Verification of detection limit of techniques in case of bakground variation. 
- Recording of technical maintenance carried out regularly. 
- Verification of robustness by using NIST traceable standards, when changing for example the batch of Liquid Scintillation Counter cocktails. 
- Verification of micropipettes used. 
- Determination of chemical efficiency for sample batches, for example for Sr-90 analysis. 
- For techniques that are validated, a validation of the method will be carried out in successive stages by laboratory analysts, evaluating the following variables according to the experimental results obtained in terms of: Accuracy, Intermediate Accuracy, Repeatability, Reproducibility , Robustness, Minimum Detectable Concentration. 
- Accreditation of laboratories under ISO 17025 Standard started in 2006 to demonstrate that there is a quality management system and the laboratories are technically competent to generate valid results.
The Environmental Control Laboratory has the following techniques accredited under ISO 17025 Standard: Determination of gamma emitters in waters; Determination of uranium in waters by fluorimetry and kinetic phosphorescence; Determination of tritium in waters and milk and the Determination of Strontium-90 in waters.","ISO 10703

Its main value is ensuring that countries have competent, comparable laboratories capable of generating reliable data under both routine and emergency conditions.

A diagnostic survey allows for the precise identification of each laboratory's equipment, personnel, methods, accreditations, and limitations, revealing gaps and opportunities. This information facilitates prioritizing technical assistance, guiding IAEA projects, defining national monitoring and modernization capacities, and strengthening inter-agency cooperation. Overall, the survey is a key tool for planning improvements, optimizing resources, and consolidating the national analytical network in alignment with ALMERA standards.","https://eu.jotform.com/uploads/ALMERANetworkContactPoint/252734998180368/6357553286225287734/2023-11-13-08-07-13-464.jpg

HPGe detectors: Equipment performance is verified on a regular basis, every week, using Gamma Vision Software. Energy calibration in a whole region of energies is checked before applying the QC procedure, which includes measurement of the detector-shield background, total activity, peak shape, and peak drift. These parameters are tracked with warning and acceptance limits (long term trend is analysed). A Co-60 point source is used for that purpose. Results of the QC are stored in a database and can be displayed and charted. Gas proportional counter: before every analytical batch, the background count rate and efficiency of the counter are checked (alpha efficiency with Am-241 and beta with Sr-90/Y-90 source). Gamma-spectrometry method: internal QC covers analysis of control samples - certified reference materials, reference materials or laboratory control samples according to the appropriate plan and program of quality control. Internal quality control method is performed through blank measurements and measurements of a control sample before each set of samples to check the accuracy and precision of the method. For control samples, the Laboratory uses reference materials and samples obtained through ALMERA intercomparison exercises. Sr-90 radiochemical method: internal QC is run with each analytical batch and consists of method blank analysis and analysis of duplicates (additional replicates of samples that are subjected to the same procedure as the original sample). The Laboratory also regularly uses reference materials containing certified amounts of the target radionuclide (LCS) to check the accuracy and precision of the method (whether the results achieved during the validation of the method are maintained).","ISO 11929

At the material level, it will shift from general-purpose membranes to specialized membranes ""tailor-made"" for specific radioactive ions. The separation process will evolve from passive filtration to intelligent separation that is actively responsive and controllable. System design will also progress from single membrane components to integrated equipment combining pretreatment, enrichment, detection, and regeneration functions. In terms of application, it will further expand from laboratory research to customized solutions for different water bodies (such as seawater, wastewater, and groundwater) and diverse usage needs (such as emergency response, real-time monitoring, and resource recovery).","Radionuclide: Sr-90, Matrix: water, Accredited (routine): Yes, Total Annual Sample Throughput (routine): >300, Total Weekly Sample Throughput (rapid): N/A

In the related work package of the project, faster, more accurate and reliable methods to determine activity concentrations of U, Th, Pu, Sr radioisotopes and Am-241 in air filters were developed. In addition, the effectiveness of a Compton suppression detector system in lowering the minimum detectable activity of 241Am in air filters was evaluated and the counting statistics with the suppression counting mode was improved.

National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA): Coordinates environmental surveillance and environmental impact assessments for licensed facilities.

Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI): Occasionally undertake radioanalytical testing of food, water, and materials for compliance and research purposes.

IAEA-supported projects (e.g. RAF/7/011, INT/9/263) have also contributed to regional environmental monitoring and capacity building.","1. Institutional and Legal Interface (Coordination Gap)Description:  lack of clearly defined, harmonized roles between KNRA and the Environmental Regulator (NEMA) concerning environmental radiation oversight.
 - Lack of clear interface and documented protocols to ensure seamless data sharing, regulatory authority, and joint response planning for environmental radiation issues between KNRA and other relevant agencies (e.g., water, health, mining).

2. Limited Human and Financial Resources: Challenges often include:Staffing: Insufficient number of trained personnel for field sampling, data interpretation, and quality assurance.Equipment: The need for specialized, highly sensitive equipment for low-level detection, which is expensive to purchase, maintain, and calibrate.
- Need for adequate financial and human resource allocation to fully fund the comprehensive monitoring plan and continuous capacity building (e.g., training in advanced alpha, and beta spectrometry, and data management).",KNRA although at some instances with NEMA.,Yes,"Limits conform to WHO recommendations

These stations conduct ongoing measurements of the power of the spatial dose equivalent H*(10), ambient gamma dose rate and spectrum caused by radioactive elements in the air and in the ground, and basic weather parameters (precipitation and ambient temperature). The 9 stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW) also conduct continuous measurements of ambient gamma dose rate and take measurements of the activity of atmospheric aerosols and total precipitation. There are also 13 auxiliary stations of the Ministry of National Defence (MON) that perform measurements of ambient gamma dose rate.",No,,"Emergency exposure situations: 
in cases of radiation emergency, intervention measures are taken based on whether the incident is occurring within the area of a given organizational unit (on-site emergency incidents), or for those incidents with impacts reaching beyond the organizational unit ('regional' and 'national' emergency incidents, including those of cross-border effects). The head of the given entity, a provincial governor or a minister of the interior are in charge of eliminating the hazard and the consequences of the incident, depending on the scale of emergency.  
Around nuclear facilities: radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the Świerk Nuclear Centre is conducted by our laboratory (that is, the Radiation Protection Measurements Laboratory of the National Centre for Nuclear Research) according to a monitoring programme approved by the President of PAA. There are additional independent specialized centres selected annually by the President of PAA in the vicinity of the Centre which also carry out monitoring duties. Radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the National Radioactive Waste Repository (KSOP) is conducted by the Radioactive Waste Management Plant and by the nearby laboratory commissioned by the PAA’s President. 
Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): the 'Program of radiological monitoring of areas degraded due to uranium ore extraction and processing' has been implemented at the former uranium ore plants since 1998. In 2018 the following measures were undertaken: measurements of radioactive alpha and beta isotopes in drinking water (from public water intakes) within the territory managed by the Association of Municipalities of the Karkonosze Region, as well as in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings); and the determination of radon concentration in water from public intakes, in water supplied to residential premises, and in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings).",,,,,,,,"Po-210 in water; Ra-226 in sand; Cs-137 in sand; Pb-210 in sand; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in air filter; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in soil; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in metal ore/crushed rock; soil/sediment (lake or river sediment), Sr-90 (10-100 Bq/kg); soil/sediment (lake or river sediment), plutonium isotopes Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240 (0.1-10 Bq/kg); dried vegetables (leaf vegetables or root vegetables), Sr-90 (5-30 Bq/kg or more); milk powder, Sr-90 (1-10 Bq/kg); Ra-226, Ra-228 in drinking water",,Training Courses; Training Workshops,,,
