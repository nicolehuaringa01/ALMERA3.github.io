Until 2018 it had participated in more than 30 intercomparisons in different matrices, including: water, soil, vegetables, grass, pine needles, filters, air and ashes. The radionuclides involved were gamma emitters, gross alpha and  gross-beta, tritium, Rn-222, transuranic elements, uranium, Sr-90, Po-210 and Ra-226. The intercomparison exercises were organized by the following organizations: Laboratoire D’Analyses de Biologie Medicale de Commissariat a L’Energie Atomique (CEA) / Centre d’Estudes de Valduc - Direction des Applications Militaires (DAM), France Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), USA American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists-(AARST), USA National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), Bundesamt für Strahlenchutz- Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BFS),  Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK, UK National Health Laboratory (NPL), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) USA, CSN-CIEMAT Spain, CNEA- Gcia de Área Seguridad Nuclear y Ambiente-Gcia Gestión de la Calidad- Interlab, Argentina, AIRP, ARPA, FANR and ENEA, Italy.

- A fundamental aspect regarding quality assurance of measurements is the regular participation in intercomparison exercises or proficiency test programs organized by laboratories with international recognition (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Physical Laboratory (NPL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
- Calibration of the measurement systems according to each laboratory using calibration sources or certified reference materials from internationally recognized laboratories. 
- Preparation of control charts to verify that equipments measure correctly. 
- Verification of background measurements for the measurement system. 
- Verification of detection limit of techniques in case of bakground variation. 
- Recording of technical maintenance carried out regularly. 
- Verification of robustness by using NIST traceable standards, when changing for example the batch of Liquid Scintillation Counter cocktails. 
- Verification of micropipettes used. 
- Determination of chemical efficiency for sample batches, for example for Sr-90 analysis. 
- For techniques that are validated, a validation of the method will be carried out in successive stages by laboratory analysts, evaluating the following variables according to the experimental results obtained in terms of: Accuracy, Intermediate Accuracy, Repeatability, Reproducibility , Robustness, Minimum Detectable Concentration. 
- Accreditation of laboratories under ISO 17025 Standard started in 2006 to demonstrate that there is a quality management system and the laboratories are technically competent to generate valid results.
The Environmental Control Laboratory has the following techniques accredited under ISO 17025 Standard: Determination of gamma emitters in waters; Determination of uranium in waters by fluorimetry and kinetic phosphorescence; Determination of tritium in waters and milk and the Determination of Strontium-90 in waters.","ISO 10703
