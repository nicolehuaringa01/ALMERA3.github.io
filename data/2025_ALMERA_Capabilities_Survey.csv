In the related work package of the project, faster, more accurate and reliable methods to determine activity concentrations of U, Th, Pu, Sr radioisotopes and Am-241 in air filters were developed. In addition, the effectiveness of a Compton suppression detector system in lowering the minimum detectable activity of 241Am in air filters was evaluated and the counting statistics with the suppression counting mode was improved.

HPGe detectors: Equipment performance is verified on a regular basis, every week, using Gamma Vision Software. Energy calibration in a whole region of energies is checked before applying the QC procedure, which includes measurement of the detector-shield background, total activity, peak shape, and peak drift. These parameters are tracked with warning and acceptance limits (long term trend is analysed). A Co-60 point source is used for that purpose. Results of the QC are stored in a database and can be displayed and charted. Gas proportional counter: before every analytical batch, the background count rate and efficiency of the counter are checked (alpha efficiency with Am-241 and beta with Sr-90/Y-90 source). Gamma-spectrometry method: internal QC covers analysis of control samples - certified reference materials, reference materials or laboratory control samples according to the appropriate plan and program of quality control. Internal quality control method is performed through blank measurements and measurements of a control sample before each set of samples to check the accuracy and precision of the method. For control samples, the Laboratory uses reference materials and samples obtained through ALMERA intercomparison exercises. Sr-90 radiochemical method: internal QC is run with each analytical batch and consists of method blank analysis and analysis of duplicates (additional replicates of samples that are subjected to the same procedure as the original sample). The Laboratory also regularly uses reference materials containing certified amounts of the target radionuclide (LCS) to check the accuracy and precision of the method (whether the results achieved during the validation of the method are maintained).",Yes,"Annually

- Calibration of the measurement systems according to each laboratory using calibration sources or certified reference materials from internationally recognized laboratories. 
- Preparation of control charts to verify that equipments measure correctly. 
- Verification of background measurements for the measurement system. 
- Verification of detection limit of techniques in case of bakground variation. 
- Recording of technical maintenance carried out regularly. 
- Verification of robustness by using NIST traceable standards, when changing for example the batch of Liquid Scintillation Counter cocktails. 
- Verification of micropipettes used. 
- Determination of chemical efficiency for sample batches, for example for Sr-90 analysis. 
- For techniques that are validated, a validation of the method will be carried out in successive stages by laboratory analysts, evaluating the following variables according to the experimental results obtained in terms of: Accuracy, Intermediate Accuracy, Repeatability, Reproducibility , Robustness, Minimum Detectable Concentration. 
- Accreditation of laboratories under ISO 17025 Standard started in 2006 to demonstrate that there is a quality management system and the laboratories are technically competent to generate valid results.
