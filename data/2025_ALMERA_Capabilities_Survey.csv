In the related work package of the project, faster, more accurate and reliable methods to determine activity concentrations of U, Th, Pu, Sr radioisotopes and Am-241 in air filters were developed. In addition, the effectiveness of a Compton suppression detector system in lowering the minimum detectable activity of 241Am in air filters was evaluated and the counting statistics with the suppression counting mode was improved.
