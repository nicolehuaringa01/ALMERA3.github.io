In the related work package of the project, faster, more accurate and reliable methods to determine activity concentrations of U, Th, Pu, Sr radioisotopes and Am-241 in air filters were developed. In addition, the effectiveness of a Compton suppression detector system in lowering the minimum detectable activity of 241Am in air filters was evaluated and the counting statistics with the suppression counting mode was improved.

HPGe detectors: Equipment performance is verified on a regular basis, every week, using Gamma Vision Software. Energy calibration in a whole region of energies is checked before applying the QC procedure, which includes measurement of the detector-shield background, total activity, peak shape, and peak drift. These parameters are tracked with warning and acceptance limits (long term trend is analysed). A Co-60 point source is used for that purpose. Results of the QC are stored in a database and can be displayed and charted. Gas proportional counter: before every analytical batch, the background count rate and efficiency of the counter are checked (alpha efficiency with Am-241 and beta with Sr-90/Y-90 source). Gamma-spectrometry method: internal QC covers analysis of control samples - certified reference materials, reference materials or laboratory control samples according to the appropriate plan and program of quality control. Internal quality control method is performed through blank measurements and measurements of a control sample before each set of samples to check the accuracy and precision of the method. For control samples, the Laboratory uses reference materials and samples obtained through ALMERA intercomparison exercises. Sr-90 radiochemical method: internal QC is run with each analytical batch and consists of method blank analysis and analysis of duplicates (additional replicates of samples that are subjected to the same procedure as the original sample).

The maximum permitted value for Cs-137 in milk powder, wild berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries), game, fish, seafood, mushrooms (fresh and mushroom products), medicinal herbs, teas and coffee is 150 Bq/kg, or 150 Bq/l. The maximum permitted value for Cs-137 in dried mushrooms, aromas, spices and other food consumed less than 2 kg per year per capita is 600 Bq/kg, or 600 Bq/l. In the event of an accident or other radiological emergency, which indicate the possibility of contamination of food with radionuclides, and in case the circumstances so require, the following limits are applied: strontium isotopes, in particular Sr-90, are 75 Bq/kg in baby food, 125 Bq/kg or Bq/l in milk and dairy products, 750 Bq/kg in food, except for less frequently used food, 125 Bq/l in liquid food (drinks, alcohols and vinegar), and 7500 Bq/kg in less frequently used food. The limits for iodine isotopes (I-131) are 150 Bq/kg for baby food,  500 Bq/kg or Bq/l for milk and dairy products, 2000 Bq/kg for food, except for less frequently used food, 500 Bq/l for liquid food (drinks, alcohols and vinegar), and 20000 Bq/kg for less frequently used food. Limits for alpha unstable isotopes of plutonium, transplutonium elements, especially Pu-239 and Am-241, are 1 Bq/kg for baby food, 20 Bq/kg or Bq/l for milk and dairy products, 80 Bq/kg for food, except for less frequently used food, 20 Bq/l for liquid food (drinks, alcohols and vinegar), and 800 Bq/kg for less frequently used food. Limits for all other radionuclides with a half-life greater than 10 days, especially Cs-134 and Cs-137 (excluding C-14, H-3, K-40), are 400 Bq/kg for baby food, 1000 Bq/kg or Bq/l for milk and dairy products, 1250 Bq/kg for food, except for less frequently used food, 1250 Bq/l for liquid food (drinks, alcohols and vinegar), and 12500 Bq/kg for less frequently used food. The maximum permitted value of total Cs-134 and Cs-137 in animal feed after an accident is 1250 Bq/kg for pigs, 2500 Bq/kg for poultry, lambs, calves, and 5000 Bq/kg for other animals. Drinking water parameter values for radon, tritium and indicative doses are 100 Bq/l for radon and 100 Bq/l for tritium, with an indicative dose of 0.1 mSv. Derived concentrations of radionuclides in drinking water are U-238: 3.0 Bq/l, U-234: 2.8 Bq/l, Ra-226: 0.5 Bq/l, Ra-228: 0.2 Bq/l, Pb-210: 0.2 Bq/l, Po-210: 0.1 Bq/l, C-14: 240 Bq/l, Sr-90: 4.9 Bq/l, Pu-239/Pu-240: 0.6 Bq/l, Am-241: 0.7 Bq/l, Co-60: 40 Bq/l, Cs-134: 7.2 Bq/l, Cs-137: 11 Bq/l, I-131: 6,2 Bq/l. If the total alpha activity or total beta activity is less than 0.1 Bq/l and 1.0 Bq/l, respectively, the indicative dose is assumed to be less than the parametric value 0.1 mSv and Nofurther radiological examinations are required, unless there is information about the presence of radionuclides from other sources that can lead to values for an indicative dose greater than 0.1 mSv. If the total alpha activity is greater than 0.1 Bq/l or the total beta activity is greater than 1.0 Bq/l, analysis of individual radionuclides is required. If the results of individual radionuclides in drinking water are available and if their activity concentrations exceed 20% of the the derived concentrations, or the tritium content exceeds the parametric value, then an additional analysis of the radionuclide content is performed.

The laboratory takes part in national and international proficiency tests at least once in every accreditation cycle--that is, once every four years--for each accredited method used. The laboratory also takes part in proficiency tests for non-accredited methods. Reproducibility tests (intra-laboratory) are also run for accredited methods according to the annual schedule. The measuring equipment--Liquid Scintillation Counter counters, gas-flow proportional counters, alpha spectrometer, gamma spectrometry systems(?)--are tested and calibrated with appropriate reference sources and solutions (control charts are also run and kept). Other equipment: Laboratory balances are calibrated by an external company (most often the balance manufacturer service) with certified weights. Some are also legalised by the Polish national metrology authority (Central Office of Measures), which certifies that the measuring instrument meets the requirements. Internal testing is also performed before each weighing.

In emergency situations",,,Yes,22,Yes,"There is a network of: 13 ASS-500 stations owned by the Central Laboratory of Radiological Protection, that continuously sample atmospheric aerosols on filters and perform spectrometric determination of the content of individual radioisotopes on a weekly basis. There are also 9 stations operated by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW), 7 of which conduct the continuous measurement of ambient gamma dose rate and the continuous measurement of total and artificial alpha and beta activity of atmospheric aerosols. The stations also measure total beta activity in 24-hour and monthly samples of total fallout, and  determine the content of Cs-137 (by a spectrometric method) and Sr-90 (by a radiochemical method) in cumulative monthly samples of total fallout from all 9 stations once a month.",Yes,"There is a national network of early warning stations for radiation contamination, consisting of the 13 ASS-500 stations described in the previous section, as well as 58 automatic Permanent Monitoring Stations (PMS) managed by PAA which operate under the international systems of the EU and of the Baltic Sea States. These stations conduct ongoing measurements of the power of the spatial dose equivalent H*(10), ambient gamma dose rate and spectrum caused by radioactive elements in the air and in the ground, and basic weather parameters (precipitation and ambient temperature). The 9 stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW) also conduct continuous measurements of ambient gamma dose rate and take measurements of the activity of atmospheric aerosols and total precipitation. There are also 13 auxiliary stations of the Ministry of National Defence (MON) that perform measurements of ambient gamma dose rate.",No,,"Emergency exposure situations: 
in cases of radiation emergency, intervention measures are taken based on whether the incident is occurring within the area of a given organizational unit (on-site emergency incidents), or for those incidents with impacts reaching beyond the organizational unit ('regional' and 'national' emergency incidents, including those of cross-border effects). The head of the given entity, a provincial governor or a minister of the interior are in charge of eliminating the hazard and the consequences of the incident, depending on the scale of emergency.  
Around nuclear facilities: radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the Świerk Nuclear Centre is conducted by our laboratory (that is, the Radiation Protection Measurements Laboratory of the National Centre for Nuclear Research) according to a monitoring programme approved by the President of PAA. There are additional independent specialized centres selected annually by the President of PAA in the vicinity of the Centre which also carry out monitoring duties. Radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the National Radioactive Waste Repository (KSOP) is conducted by the Radioactive Waste Management Plant and by the nearby laboratory commissioned by the PAA’s President. 
Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): the 'Program of radiological monitoring of areas degraded due to uranium ore extraction and processing' has been implemented at the former uranium ore plants since 1998. In 2018 the following measures were undertaken: measurements of radioactive alpha and beta isotopes in drinking water (from public water intakes) within the territory managed by the Association of Municipalities of the Karkonosze Region, as well as in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings); and the determination of radon concentration in water from public intakes, in water supplied to residential premises, and in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings).",,,,,,,,"Po-210 in water; Ra-226 in sand; Cs-137 in sand; Pb-210 in sand; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in air filter; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in soil; Po-210 in equilibrium with Pb-210 in metal ore/crushed rock; soil/sediment (lake or river sediment), Sr-90 (10-100 Bq/kg); soil/sediment (lake or river sediment), plutonium isotopes Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240 (0.1-10 Bq/kg); dried vegetables (leaf vegetables or root vegetables), Sr-90 (5-30 Bq/kg or more); milk powder, Sr-90 (1-10 Bq/kg); Ra-226, Ra-228 in drinking water",Training Courses; Training Workshops,,,

Since 2001 it operates instrumentation for measurements and data analysis at the IASOA, GAW and ACTRIS Zeppelin station, Ny Aalesund Svalbard in the European High Arctic for monitoring Black Carbon and Aerosol absorption.
ΕΝRACT has organised and implemented several measurement campaigns for the characterization of urban particulate pollution, the identification of the major emission sources and the quantification of their contribution to concentration levels, as well as the assessment of the respective impact on human health. In the framework of recent research projects on urban air quality, ΕΝRACT has enhanced the capacity of local, regional and national authorities, by providing evidence on air pollution levels and sources, transferring know-how and experience and providing tools for effective urban air quality management.
ΕΝRACT is the only Laboratory, to which GAEC (EAEE) has assigned the continuous control of environmental radioactivity in Greece. The provision of this national service satisfies the obligations provided by the Greek Legislation on Radiation Protection and the relevant EU Regulations.",,
