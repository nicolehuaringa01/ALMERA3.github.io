Around nuclear facilities: aerosols monitoring (annually); dose rate (integrated every six months); humidity condensates (weekly); milk (monthly); soils and sediments (annually); food (sampled monthly and measured every 3 months as pools); fish (sampled monthly and measured every six months as pools); waters (monthly). Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): uranium sites are not considered legacy sites as they are under regulatory control. Environmental monitoring is performed once a year (uranium and Ra-226 analysis in waters (surface, drinking waters, aquifer) and radon emantion rate from the tales). Also radon in air in the surroundings and dwellings.    ",,Our institution: Nuclear Regulatory Authority,Yes,"Control of data arising from environmental monitoring around installations are compared (by converting to dose) with dose restrictions to the public. In the case of drinking water, we use the data to make comparisons and explain to the public the values established by WHO for drinking water. In the case of the international trade of food, we use the guideline values established by Codex Alimentarius for international trade. In the hypothetical case the measured activity concentration is higher than the corresponding Guideline Levels, since these levels are quite conservative. The evaluation of the effective dose due to the annual consumption of radionuclides in food must be calculated with country-specific values (national consumption for example).

There are also 9 stations operated by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW), 7 of which conduct the continuous measurement of ambient gamma dose rate and the continuous measurement of total and artificial alpha and beta activity of atmospheric aerosols. The stations also measure total beta activity in 24-hour and monthly samples of total fallout, and  determine the content of Cs-137 (by a spectrometric method) and Sr-90 (by a radiochemical method) in cumulative monthly samples of total fallout from all 9 stations once a month.  ",Yes,"There is a national network of early warning stations for radiation contamination, consisting of the 12 ASS-500 stations described in the previous section, as well as 19 automatic Permanent Monitoring Stations (PMS) managed by PAA which operate under the international systems of the EU and of the Baltic Sea States. These stations conduct ongoing measurements of the power of the spatial dose equivalent H*(10), ambient gamma dose rate and spectrum caused by radioactive elements in the air and in the ground, and basic weather parameters (precipitation and ambient temperature). The 9 stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMiGW) also conduct continuous measurements of ambient gamma dose rate and take measurements of the activity of atmospheric aerosols and total precipitation. There are also 13 auxiliary stations of the Ministry of National Defence (MON) that perform measurements of ambient gamma dose rate. ",No,,"Emergency exposure situations: 
in cases of radiation emergency, intervention measures are taken based on whether the incident is occurring within the area of a given organizational unit (on-site emergency incidents), or for those incidents with impacts reaching beyond the organizational unit ('regional' and 'national' emergency incidents, including those of cross-border effects). The head of the given entity, a provincial governor or a minister of the interior are in charge of eliminating the hazard and the consequences of the incident, depending on the scale of emergency.  
Around nuclear facilities: radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the Świerk Nuclear Centre is conducted by our laboratory (that is, the Radiation Protection Measurements Laboratory of the National Centre for Nuclear Research) according to a monitoring programme approved by the President of PAA. There are additional independent specialized centres selected annually by the President of PAA in the vicinity of the Centre which also carry out monitoring duties. Radiological monitoring on the premises and in the vicinity of the National Radioactive Waste Repository (KSOP) is conducted by the Radioactive Waste Management Plant and by the nearby laboratory commissioned by the PAA’s President. 
Existing exposure situations (e.g. uranium legacy sites): the 'Program of radiological monitoring of areas degraded due to uranium ore extraction and processing' has been implemented at the former uranium ore plants since 1998. In 2018 the following measures were undertaken: measurements of radioactive alpha and beta isotopes in drinking water (from public water intakes) within the territory managed by the Association of Municipalities of the Karkonosze Region, as well as in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings); and the determination of radon concentration in water from public intakes, in water supplied to residential premises, and in surface and underground water (outflows from underground workings).
