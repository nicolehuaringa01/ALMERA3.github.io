  <h1>The ALMERA Network</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>ALMERA network</strong> (Analytical Laboratories for the Measurement of Environmental Radioactivity) was established by the IAEA in 1995, and is a cooperative effort of analytical laboratories world-wide. Members of the network are nominated by their respective IAEA Member States as those laboratories which would be expected to provide reliable and timely analysis of environmental samples in the event of an accidental or intentional release of radioactivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    As of <strong>June 2024</strong>, ALMERA consists of <strong>202 laboratories</strong> representing <strong>90 countries</strong>. The Agency's Marine Environment Laboratories in Monaco and the Terrestrial Environmental Radiochemistry (TERC) Laboratory of the IAEA Physical and Chemical Sciences Division are additional members of the network. The <strong>IAEA Marine Environment Laboratories</strong> act as the central coordinator of the ALMERA network's activities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The IAEA helps the ALMERA network maintain readiness through coordination activities such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Organizing meetings</li>
    <li>Developing standardized methods for sample collection and analysis</li>
    <li>Conducting interlaboratory comparison exercises and proficiency tests as tools for external quality control</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Participation in ALMERA activities provides the following benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Demonstration of technical competence of ALMERA laboratories through participation in proficiency tests</li>
    <li>Wider application of recommended validated methods and methodological harmonization, enhancing worldwide comparability of environmental radioactivity measurements</li>
    <li>Shared information on analytical capabilities and expertise, facilitating rapid identification of laboratories with specific competencies during emergencies</li>
  </ul>
